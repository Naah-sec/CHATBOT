# llama3 Local Chatbot Demo (Built by GitHub Copilot Agent)

This project is a full-stack, privacy-first chatbot system that runs entirely on your machine. It features a modern React frontend and a Django REST Framework backend, powered by a local llama3 LLM via Ollama. The chatbot remembers your conversation context and provides a beautiful, responsive chat experience.

> **This project was fully built and iteratively improved by the GitHub Copilot agent as a real-world test of its coding and reasoning abilities. All requirements were met, and the system works as intended.**

---

## Features

- **Local LLM**: Uses llama3 via Ollama, so your data never leaves your device.
- **Memory**: The bot remembers previous messages in the current chat session for contextual, coherent conversations.
- **Modern UI**: Responsive, stylish React frontend with Material-UI.
- **Streaming**: Bot responses appear in real time, like ChatGPT.
- **API-first**: Django REST Framework backend with clean endpoints.
- **Easy to run**: Simple setup for both backend and frontend.
- **Dockerized**: Run everything with a single command using Docker Compose.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized setup)
- Ollama (with llama3 model pulled, if running locally)

---

## Setup & Running

### Option 1: Run Everything with Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Build and start all services (backend, frontend, Ollama) in containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Ollama API: http://localhost:11434

2. **Stop all services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

---

### Option 2: Manual Local Setup (No Docker)

#### 1. Backend (Django + DRF)
```bash
cd chatbot_demo
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

#### 2. Frontend (React)
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### 3. Ollama (llama3 LLM)
```bash
ollama pull llama3
ollama serve
```

## API Usage

### Create a New Chat
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chats/
```

### Send a Message (with memory)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chats/1/send_message/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, how are you?"}'
```

### Stream a Message (Server-Sent Events)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chats/1/stream_message/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Tell me about yourself"}'
```

---

## Project Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Material-UI, Axios, streaming chat UI
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework, SQLite (default), chat memory logic
- **LLM**: llama3 via Ollama HTTP API
- **Models**: `Chat` (session), `Message` (user/assistant, with timestamps)

---

## Testing

To run backend tests:
```bash
python manage.py test chat
```
